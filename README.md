This application is a Pinia tutorial built to practice using the Store Setup model.
In addition, It utilizes a local JSon file to create persistent data and practice async await functionality.

To run this application first install the dependencies
open a terminal and run...
  "npm install"

then, if you don't have json server installed, 
inside the terminal run...
  "npm install -g json-server"

next, inside the terminal you will open a json server to host the internal db file stored in the project
  "json-server -w src/data/db.json"

finally, use
  "npm run dev" 
to poke around in the browser
